/**
 * A simple, generic event handler.
 *
 * It's pretty common in UI's that you have a central object
 * that manages the app. This makes the wiring simpler.
 *
 * When something happens in the app, it tells the central
 * object that it's happening. The central object then tells
 * the application components to all update.
 *
 * This is a class for helping to build that model. You can
 * add callbacks to this event handler, and then tell it to
 * run all those callbacks on demand. That way the updates
 * can be easily added, and run, as needed.
 *
 * You can attach functions, using 'add', and then run them later,
 * using 'context'.

/**
 * EventRunner timing utility function.
 *
 * A common design pattern is to run a function repeatedly, using setTimeout,
 * but when you schedule a function to run, all previously waiting functions
 * should be cancelled.
 *
 * Something like:
 *
 * const currentWork = null
 *
 * function run( callback ) {
 *     if ( currentWork !== null ) {
 *      clearTimeout( currentWork )
 *     }
 *
 *     currentWork = setTimeout( function() {
 *          currentWork = null
 *          callback()
 *     } )
 * }
 *
 * The idea is that 'runBar' might be called repeatedly,
 * and each time it cancels any existing work,
 * and sets up a new batch of work to be run instead.
 *
 * If there is no work to be cancelled, then the current work
 * is run anyway.
 *
 * The EventRunner implements this design pattern.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     const runner = new EventRunner( timeout )
 *     runner.run( function() {
 *          // do work
 *     } )
 *
 * If 'run' is called before the previous 'run' was ever called,
 * then the previous 'run' is cancelled, and the new one replaces it.
 *
 * To clarify, and to help be clear about what this does:
 * 'run' will cancel a timeout for a previously set function,
 * if you call 'run' before that timeout is fired.
 * This is the whole point of this EventRunner.
 *
 * 'run' can also be cancelled using the 'clear' method,
 * and 'maybeRun' allows you to only set if there is not a function
 * waiting. 'isPending' also allows you to check if a function is set
 * for a timeout, or not.
 *
 * The time to use for timeouts is set in the constructor.
